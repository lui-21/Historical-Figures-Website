# Historical-Figures-Website
This project is a web-based educational platform that highlights the top 10 most influential historical figures in Philippine history. The website is designed with a vintage aesthetic and responsive layout to engage users of all ages.
In today’s digital age, preserving Filipino heritage and recognizing the contributions of national heroes can be achieved through creative and modern platforms. This project introduces a historically themed website titled “Top 10 Historical Figures of the Philippines,” designed to provide users with an immersive and educational experience about the most prominent Filipino heroes. With a layout inspired by vintage aesthetics, the site uses warm earth tones, serif fonts like Cinzel and Cormorant Garamond, and historically relevant visuals such as the Philippine flag and old-style imagery. It aims to foster a deeper appreciation for Philippine history, especially among students and educators, by making the stories of our heroes both accessible and visually compelling.

One related study by Dominguez and Medina (2019) emphasizes that interactive digital platforms enhance the learning of historical content by increasing user engagement and retention. Inspired by this, the website integrates various interactive features that go beyond plain text. Among the key features are a hero gallery arranged in a responsive grid layout, a fade-in animation effect to draw visual focus, a fixed navigation bar with hover highlights, and the use of localStorage to track and display the user’s five most recently viewed hero profiles. Each hero has a dedicated clickable image that leads to an individual biography page, giving users a focused look into each historical figure’s life and impact. The homepage also includes a dynamic layout that adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring the site is both mobile and desktop friendly. Best of all, the website is completely free and accessible to everyone, making historical knowledge available to all who wish to learn.

The objectives of this project are to develop a website that not only serves as an educational resource but also promotes national pride, preserves cultural knowledge, and supports digital literacy. It seeks to encourage users to explore the stories of national heroes through a creative, engaging, and easily navigable web platform. In conclusion, this website stands as a tribute to the bravery, wisdom, and sacrifice of our Filipino heroes. It uses the power of web development to breathe life into history, combining aesthetics and technology to create an interactive archive for both learning and reflection. By remembering and celebrating the past through this platform, we pass on the spirit of patriotism to future generations.
